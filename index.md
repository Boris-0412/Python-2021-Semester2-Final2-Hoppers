I'm Boris.
This is my Hoppers game.When you play this game.You have twenty frogs.The way to win this game is to let there is only one frog left.
But how to delete the frog?When one frog jump over another frog,the one which is under will delete.
But there's a lows.You can't jump to the place which there isn't any frog between "start place" and "end place".
So that's the whole game how to work.Hope you enjoy my game.
